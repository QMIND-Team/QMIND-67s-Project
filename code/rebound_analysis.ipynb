We can see that there are 58 unique game dates implying that out dataset contains shots from 58 games. What is interesting and something we will explore later on in this notebook is that there are 2315 shot attempts that created a rebound and only 283 shots after a rebound. Another useful row is the \"top\" row. We can see that, as expected the Ottawa 67's have the most shot attempts (as this is data from only their games). Also that most shot attempts occur on 5-5, coming from forwards, after having O-zone pressure and being taken from the perimeter of the ice. These are interesting insights that we will use later on in our analysis."
