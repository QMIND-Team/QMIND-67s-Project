`OHL Clustering`
> This project collects data using a webscraper and applies a K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster players into four groups based on four different player stats.  A GUI was created to allow a user to be able to choose the data and stats used to cluster and then display the lists of players in each cluster, a graphical representation of the average normalized stats for each cluster and a 2D visualization of the clusters.
