> cluster_GUI.py
This GUI used the data collected from the OHL-webscraper and a K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster players into 4 groups.  The GUI allows users to choose the league, years, age and stats they want used in the clustering and displays a list of players in each cluster, a 2D visualization of the clusters and a bar graph to compare the average normalized statistics for each cluster.
